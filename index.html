            <h2>About the Game</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Mafia Wars: The Prohibition</strong> is an engaging board game prototype set in the tumultuous era of the <em>1920s Prohibition</em>, a time when the United States government enacted the 18th Amendment, banning the manufacture, sale, and transportation of alcoholic beverages. This period, from <strong>1920 to 1933</strong>, gave rise to a vibrant and often violent underground economy, as organized crime syndicates stepped in to meet the public's demand for illegal alcohol.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cities across the United States became battlegrounds for control over the lucrative black market for booze, with notorious figures like <strong>Al Capone</strong> in Chicago and <strong>Lucky Luciano</strong> in New York building criminal empires through bribery, extortion, and ruthless violence. Speakeasies, illicit bars hidden from the authorities, flourished as hubs of nightlife and culture, often protected by the very law enforcement officials tasked with shutting them down.
            </p>
            <p>
                Prohibition inadvertently led to the professionalization of organized crime, with <em>mafia families</em> operating with military-like precision, employing bootleggers to smuggle alcohol, establishing clandestine breweries and distilleries, and creating a sophisticated network of corruption and influence. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Players take on the roles of influential <strong>mafia bosses</strong>, each with their own unique abilities and resources, strategically managing their resources, forming alliances, and outmaneuvering rivals to dominate the underworld by controlling key businesses such as speakeasies, gambling dens, and smuggling operations.

            <h2>Description of The Game</h2>
            <p>The game is played over <strong>30 turns</strong>, each consisting of various actions players can take. At the beginning of each turn, a market card is drawn to set the price of goods. Players then roll a six-sided die to determine their order of play for that round. Actions include <strong>producing goods, building structures, leveling up structures, dismantling structures,</strong> and <strong>selling goods</strong>. Players can also <strong>trade</strong> or engage in <strong>attacks</strong> such as <strong>robbing</strong> or <strong>sabotaging</strong> other players' structures.</p>
            <p>To <strong>sell goods</strong>, players move their pieces toward market spaces and throw dice to determine success based on their proximity to the market. <strong>Trading</strong> requires mutual agreement and use of the bargain table to set prices. <strong>Attacks</strong> involve dice rolls to determine success and can result in gaining or losing <strong>fame tokens</strong>.</p>
            <p>The goal is to accumulate the most points by the end of the game, earned through <strong>fame, structures,</strong> and <strong>money</strong>. <strong>Fame</strong> can be gained or lost through various actions, such as injuring players, sabotaging structures, or failing to achieve certain goals.</p>
