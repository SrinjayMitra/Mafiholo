            <h2>About the Game</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Mafia Wars: The Prohibition</strong> is an engaging board game prototype set in the tumultuous era of the <em>1920s Prohibition</em>, a time when the United States government enacted the 18th Amendment, banning the manufacture, sale, and transportation of alcoholic beverages. This period, from <strong>1920 to 1933</strong>, gave rise to a vibrant and often violent underground economy, as organized crime syndicates stepped in to meet the public's demand for illegal alcohol.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cities across the United States became battlegrounds for control over the lucrative black market for booze, with notorious figures like <strong>Al Capone</strong> in Chicago and <strong>Lucky Luciano</strong> in New York building criminal empires through bribery, extortion, and ruthless violence. Speakeasies, illicit bars hidden from the authorities, flourished as hubs of nightlife and culture, often protected by the very law enforcement officials tasked with shutting them down.
            </p>
            <p>
                Prohibition inadvertently led to the professionalization of organized crime, with <em>mafia families</em> operating with military-like precision, employing bootleggers to smuggle alcohol, establishing clandestine breweries and distilleries, and creating a sophisticated network of corruption and influence. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Players take on the roles of influential <strong>mafia bosses</strong>, each with their own unique abilities and resources, strategically managing their resources, forming alliances, and outmaneuvering rivals to dominate the underworld by controlling key businesses such as speakeasies, gambling dens, and smuggling operations.

            <h2>Backstory of The Game</h2>
            <p>
                The game is set in the <b>1920s</b> when <b>Prohibition</b> was a law in the United States, characterized by <b>jazz music</b>, underground <b>speakeasies</b>, and an illegal economy thriving on the selling of alcohol as well as contraband. The city looks like <b>New York</b>; it is full of life and opportunities, though this can be dangerous. The skyline is full of tall buildings while the streets are filled with luxurious theatres, hazy jazz halls, and dark alleys.
            </p>
            <p>
                This gangster-ridden metropolis has been divided into sections ruled by different groups fighting each other to establish themselves as powerful figures within its depths. The story involves four immigrants who bring their skills and aspirations from their home countries to the illegal businesses they run. These individuals have come to America intending to find richness but instead, they become trapped within a criminal underworld.
            </p>
            <p>
                Their purpose is establishing empires at the expense of their opponents, fostering alliances and deceptions as well as trying not to be caught by police.
            </p>
            <p class="highlight">
                Experience the thrill of building your empire, navigating the dangerous streets, and making deals in the shadows of the jazz age!

            <h2>Characters</h2>
            <p>
                <b>A) Marco Rossi ("The Chemist") (The Drug Dealer) (Sicily, Italy)</b>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Marco Rossi grew up in the narrow streets of Palermo, where he was surrounded by the influence of the Sicilian Mafia. His father was a small-time pharmacist with a knack for chemistry, and Marco inherited his talent for concoctions. However, the family business struggled, and Marco turned to the local mob for work, quickly proving his worth with his skill in creating illicit substances. The allure of America drew him across the Atlantic. Arriving in New York, Marco found a city ripe with opportunity for someone with his skills. He quickly established himself in Little Italy through networking and manufacturing drugs. Using a genuine pharmaceutical shop as cover, Marco produces whatever drug from heroin to cocaine that may be trendy. He is meticulous and strategic, always staying one step ahead of the law and his competitors. Marco is methodical and intelligent, with a deep understanding of chemistry and a coldly calculating demeanor. He is loyal to those he considers family but ruthless to his enemies. His immigrant roots make him fiercely protective of his community but knows no bounds when it comes to ambition or greed.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <b>B) Katarzyna Nowak ("Kat") (The Gun Runner) (Warsaw, Poland)</b>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Katarzyna Nowak, popularly known as Kat, grew up in war-torn and politically unsettled Poland. Her family was involved in the resistance against the occupying forces and she learned how to handle weapons at a young age. The Nowak family fled to America after the war in search of safety as well as starting a new life. In New York’s bustling immigrant communities, Kat found that her skills were highly sought after. Kat’s initial involvement included smuggling guns for the Polish resistance within her homeland but she later saw more lucrative opportunities for herself in America’s underworld. She has established networks that import weapons from Europe and sell them to various criminal factions within the city. Her warehouses are located near the docks where she supervises delivery and distribution. With remarkable reliability and discretion, she has become an invaluable player in the underworld. She is resourceful and tough with a sharp mind for logistics and a down-to-earth attitude. She is very independent after having fought for everything she has; loyalty and integrity represent some of her most cherished values. Having encountered several life experiences she is suspicious of others yet once convinced she becomes an unwavering partner.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <b>C) Lev Petrov ("The Dealer") (The Artifact Smuggler) (Odesa, Ukraine)</b>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Lev Petrov came from Odesa, a town recognized for its lively trading and history steeped in culture. His relatives were esteemed sellers of antiquities with Lev growing up amidst priceless relics and historical items. After the upheavals of the Russian Revolution and the ensuing Civil War, Petrovs fled to America with a little bit of knowledge and a few precious things. In New York City Lev found a niche in stolen and smuggled artifacts on the black market. He developed relationships with corrupt officials as well as criminals, through which he facilitated the movement of valuable things from Europe and elsewhere. Lev operates out of a seemingly legitimate antique shop which is located in one of the most affluent neighborhoods in New York City that specializes in both legal sales and illegal dealings. His deep insight into art and history gives him an edge over other traders since he can easily make sound judgments. Lev is charmingly cultured with a taste for the good life. With enough understanding, he can be clever enough to maneuver through any complexities inherent within the black market industry. While he enjoys the thrill of the trade, he also harbors a deep respect for the artifacts he deals in, seeing himself as a protector of cultural heritage, although in a dubious manner.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <b>D) Aisling O'Connor ("Ash”) (The Boot Legger) (Dublin, Ireland)</b>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Aisling O'Connor or Ash as she is more commonly known, was brought up in the poor neighbourhoods of Dublin where her family operated a small bar. The O’Connors were forced to flee Ireland by the tough economic conditions and political upheaval. In New York City, Ash’s family tried to set up a legal business only for prohibition to throw them into disarray. Having learned brewing and distilling informally from her family’s pub, Ash saw an opportunity in the illegal booze market. Starting with limited homemade moonshine sold through speakeasies, her operations soon expanded. This entailed creating a supply chain for a variety of illicit products and services that she was offering. Ash's base is a hidden distillery located underground in one of the rundown buildings where she supervises the production and sale of different types of alcohol. Ash is hot-headed and strong-willed with a sharp tongue and assertive demeanour. She has immense pride in both her Irish heritage and America’s success story. Her entrepreneurial spirit drives her to take risks, and her natural leadership skills make her a force to be reckoned with. Her team members are like siblings since she treasures solidarity.

        <h2>Tradeoff and Dillemas</h2>
        <p>
            <b> Trade-offs:</b>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <b>A)</b> The players may be left with the option of taking actions that will result in immediate benefits or rewards, for example making and selling large amounts of goods to get money quickly or investing in the security and storage of these goods for long-term stability. Overproduction without sufficient storage or defense could expose players to theft as well as sabotage.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <b>B)</b> It is a critical trade-off between allocating resources to offensive structures (e.g., dynamite crates for destroying opponent structures) or defensive ones (e.g., Tommy gun nests for protecting their structures). A too-aggressive strategy may leave a player’s holdings unprotected.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <b>C)</b> They must choose between constructing new buildings, upgrading existing ones, or saving cash for later opportunities. Each option has positive repercussions in terms of productivity capacity, storage space availability, and general game progress both immediately and over time.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <b> Dilemmas:</b>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <b>A)</b> The safehouse is always a restricted space, and when its limits are reached players must abandon some goods or turn over a round to sell them to avoid failure at the market and loss of fame. This creates tension between maximizing production on the one hand and managing risks on the other.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <b>B)</b> Indebted players are caught in a dilemma of whether to surrender their rounds to promote other factions or not. This action can reduce the debt/s they owe but will also lead them to lose fame. This creates a compromise between financial stability and keeping the fame obtained in the rounds before which must be carefully considered before deciding.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <b>C)</b> The decision of where and when to sell commodities is filled with uncertainty because of market volatility as well as travel hazards. They should put potential profits against chances of failure and lost rounds particularly when selling to far-off markets.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <b> Sacrifices:</b>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <b>A)</b> Trading a round to dismantle will give the player 50% of a structure’s initial cost which provides instant cash but cuts long-term capabilities. One must weigh the immediate financial benefit against the loss in production and defense.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <b>B)</b> It is possible for substantial rewards to come from giving up goods or reputation to sabotage or steal from others, yet that happens with considerable risk if it fails. Any attack is a calculated gamble because every failed attempt is a loss in fame and a wasted round.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <b> Risks and rewards:</b>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <b>A)</b> Using dynamite crates or attacking heavily fortified structures are very dangerous and can yield high payoffs. If they are successful, it can break the opponents’ backbone and bring lots of fame, but if they fail, it may result in huge setbacks.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <b>B)</b> Investing in high-level production and storage would greatly help players increase their capabilities simultaneously, yet they require a substantial upfront amount. The trick is to collect enough resources for these investments without leaving oneself vulnerable to attacks.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <b>C)</b> Engaging with the market brings in some risk where players can either benefit from a good chunk of money or face price cuts that are dictated by the market. Every deal is left in the hands of market cards which cannot be anticipated.

        <h2>Typical Game Duration</h2>
        <p>
           1) The total game lasts for a varied time between <b>1 hr to 2 hrs</b>. It is dependent on the experience level of the players. The first-time players take more time in taking turns as compared to the experienced players.
        </p>
        
        <p>
           2) Each turn takes <b>30 seconds to 60 seconds</b> depending upon the progress of the game. In the beginning, players take less time to decide as a smaller number of options are available to them, but as the game progresses, the number of options starts increasing in the game.

            <h2>Description of The Game</h2>
            <p>The game is played over <strong>30 turns</strong>, each consisting of various actions players can take. At the beginning of each turn, a market card is drawn to set the price of goods. Players then roll a six-sided die to determine their order of play for that round. Actions include <strong>producing goods, building structures, leveling up structures, dismantling structures,</strong> and <strong>selling goods</strong>. Players can also <strong>trade</strong> or engage in <strong>attacks</strong> such as <strong>robbing</strong> or <strong>sabotaging</strong> other players' structures.</p>
            <p>To <strong>sell goods</strong>, players move their pieces toward market spaces and throw dice to determine success based on their proximity to the market. <strong>Trading</strong> requires mutual agreement and use of the bargain table to set prices. <strong>Attacks</strong> involve dice rolls to determine success and can result in gaining or losing <strong>fame tokens</strong>.</p>
            <p>The goal is to accumulate the most points by the end of the game, earned through <strong>fame, structures,</strong> and <strong>money</strong>. <strong>Fame</strong> can be gained or lost through various actions, such as injuring players, sabotaging structures, or failing to achieve certain goals.</p>
